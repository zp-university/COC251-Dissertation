abstract = {Since its introduction in 1994 the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol (later renamed to Transport Layer Security (TLS)) evolved to the de facto standard for securing the transport layer. SSL/TLS can be used for ensuring data confidentiality, integrity and authenticity during transport. A main feature of the protocol is its flexibility. Modes of operation and security goals can easily be configured through different cipher suites. This thesis focuses on the SSL/TLS protocol suites for secure communication over untrusted media (the internet). It explains the protcol in depth (in the – at the time of writing – most common version TLS 1.0), provides a brief summary on its evolution and gives a detailed chronology of attacks and attack categories. New techniques for fingerprinting particular SSL/TLS implementations (stacks), partially down to patch level, are introduced and implemented as a tool for SSL/TLS stack inspection. Moreover, new attacks on state of the art implementations are given and a new framework, called T.I.M.E., especially designed for deep protocol inspection and penetration is presented. The attacks undermine the security goal confidentiality. Exploits for the discussed attacks are implemented by using the T.I.M.E framework. The results caused changes (fixes) in the affected implementations and highlight the need for tested, specification compliant and security optimized software.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT), sometimes referred to as the Internet of Objects, will change everything—including ourselves. This may seem like a bold statement, but consider the impact the Internet already has had on education, communication, business, science, government, and humanity. Clearly, the Internet is one of the most important and powerful creations in all of human history. Now consider that IoT represents the next evolution of the Internet, taking a huge leap in its ability to gather, analyze, and distribute data that we can turn into information, knowledge, and, ultimately, wisdom. In this context, IoT becomes immensely important. Already, IoT projects are under way that promise to close the gap between poor and rich, improve distribution of the world's resources to those who need them most, and help us understand our planet so we can be more proactive and less reactive. Even so, several barriers exist that threaten to slow IoT development, including the transition to IPv6, having a common set of standards, and developing energy sources for millions—even billions—of minute sensors. However, as businesses, governments, standards bodies, and academia work together to solve these challenges, IoT will continue to progress. The goal of this paper, therefore, is to educate you in plain and simple terms so you can be well versed in IoT and understand its potential to change everything we know to be true today.},

@article{Tendulkar2014,
abstract = {Computing platforms such as smartphones frequently access Web content using many separate applications rather than a single Web browser application. These applications often deal with sensitive user information such as financial data or passwords, and use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to protect it from unauthorized eavesdropping. However, recent studies have confirmed a wide-spread misconfiguration of SSL verification in applications. This paper considers the difficulty faced by Android application developers when modifying SSL code for using common features like pinning or using a self-signed SSL certificate. For example, developing an application that accesses a test Web server with a self-signed certificate requires additional code to remove SSL verification; however, this code is not always removed in production versions of the application. To mitigate vulnerabilities introduced because of the complexity of customizing SSL code in Android applications, we propose that common SSL configuration should be specified in the application's package manifest. We provide two concrete suggestions: 1) linking the application's debug state to SSL verification, and 2) pinning certificates and CAs in the manifest. We evaluate the appropriateness of these two suggestions on over 13,000 applications from Google's Play Store, of which 3,302 use SSL in non-advertisement code, and find that 1,889 (57.20{\%}) of these SSL applications would benefit.},

abstract = {Smartphones are increasingly used worldwide and are now an essential tool for our everyday tasks. These tasks are supported by smartphone applications (apps) which commonly rely on network communication to provide a certain utility such as online banking. From a security and privacy point of view a properly secured (encrypted) communication channel is important in order to protect sensitive information against passive and active attacks. Previous research outlined that developers often fail to implement proper certificate validation in their custom SSL/TLS implementations and thus fail to secure the network communication. Previous research however proposed solutions for developers and not for the affected users. This global growth introduced drastic changes to the network utilization. In this paper we discuss this issue on the basis of Android apps. We analyzed over 50,000 Android apps, collected during two consecutive years, regarding the correct use of SSL/TLS protocols. Furthermore, we discuss the current situation. We propose dynamic certificate pinning, a device-based solution that overcomes the problem of broken SSL/TLS implementations in Android apps. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to solve this problem by combining established techniques such as certificate pinning with dynamic instrumentation techniques to tackle one of the major security challenges in the network communication of smartphone applications.},

abstract = {This paper examines the security vulnerabilities and threats in wireless communications and investigates efficient defense mechanisms for improving the security of wireless networks, with special attention to physical-layer security, an emerging paradigm. ABSTRACT | Due to the broadcast nature of radio propaga-tion, the wireless air interface is open and accessible to both authorized and illegitimate users. This completely differs from a wired network, where communicating devices are physically connected through cables and a node without di-rect association is unable to access the network for illicit activities. The open communications environment makes wireless transmissions more vulnerable than wired communi-cations to malicious attacks, including both the passive eaves-dropping for data interception and the active jamming for disrupting legitimate transmissions. Therefore, this paper is motivated to examine the security vulnerabilities and threats imposed by the inherent open nature of wireless communica-tions and to devise efficient defense mechanisms for improv-ing the wireless network security. We first summarize the security requirements of wireless networks, including their authenticity, confidentiality, integrity, and availability issues. Next, a comprehensive overview of security attacks encoun-tered in wireless networks is presented in view of the net-work protocol architecture, where the potential security threats are discussed at each protocol layer. We also provide a survey of the existing security protocols and algorithms that are adopted in the existing wireless network standards, such as the Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, WiMAX, and the long-term evo-lution (LTE) systems. Then, we discuss the state of the art in physical-layer security, which is an emerging technique of se-curing the open communications environment against eaves-dropping attacks at the physical layer. Several physical-layer security techniques are reviewed and compared, including information-theoretic security, artificial-noise-aided security, security-oriented beamforming, diversity-assisted security, and physical-layer key generation approaches. Since a jam-mer emitting radio signals can readily interfere with the legit-imate wireless users, we also introduce the family of various jamming attacks and their countermeasures, including the constant jammer, intermittent jammer, reactive jammer, adaptive jammer, and intelligent jammer. Additionally, we discuss the integration of physical-layer security into existing authentication and cryptography mechanisms for further se-curing wireless networks. Finally, some technical challenges which remain unresolved at the time of writing are summa-rized and the future trends in wireless security are discussed.},

We present two categories of attacks against smart locks and analyze the security of five commercially-available locks with respect to these attacks. Our security analysis reveals that flaws in the design, implementation, and interaction models of existing locks can be exploited by several classes of adversaries, allowing them to learn private information about users and gain unauthorized home access. To guide future development of smart locks and similar Internet of Things devices, we propose several defenses that mitigate the attacks we present. One of these defenses is a novel approach to securely and usably communicate a user's intended actions to smart locks, which we prototype and evaluate. Ultimately, our work takes a first step towards illuminating security challenges in the system design and novel functionality introduced by emerging IoT systems. {\textcopyright} 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},
