This report covers the creation of a secure smart lock system made up of a central server, a raspberry pi core and an Android application. The idea behind this project is to make a system that is both secure and easy to use, two traits which are generally difficult to combine as generally extra security means extra complexity. The system described within this report demonstrates that it is possible to have security and ease of use side by side using the design that I have laid out.

Initially the report goes over aims and objectives for the user but also for the technical side of the project. This was an important distinction for this project as it has both complex technical and user requirements when put together. Following that a literature review looks at the current smart locks on the market to examine strengths, weaknesses and security exploits in the existing products. Once the research was completed the report moves on to the requirements, design and implementation stages of the report which focus on the product that I have built as well as potential improvements and further possible work that could be done. Finally it goes on to a conclusion covering what I most enjoyed in the project, my strengths and weaknesses throughout and my opinion of the outcome of the project as a whole.

%This section should be be entitled “Contents” and should provide a list of chapter,
%section and subsection headings with their appropriate page number. You are strongly
%advised to use the features provided within LATEX or your word-processing software to
%auto-generate this page. This ensures that the details are correct and reduces a lot of
%labour-intensive and painstaking work. An example contents page is provided at the
%start of this document (although you should note that this document is in ‘article’ style
%and therefore not structured with chapters as a dissertation would be).
